## Overview

This project aims to develop a system that enables self-driving cars to recognize and interpret traffic police hand gestures on Indian roads. The system utilizes computer vision techniques, MoveNet's Thunder pose estimation model, and machine learning algorithms to detect and classify hand gestures made by traffic police officers.

## Features

- A deep learning model that can detect and analyze Indian traffic police hand gestures in real time with high accuracy.
- Utilizes the MoveNet's Thunder model for realtime and accurate pose estimation
- Custom dataset of Indian traffic police hand gestures
- Face detection using haar cascade to analyze which direction the policeman is facing.
